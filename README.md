# TCP-3Way-Handshake-Simulator
##Overview
The TCP client/server simulator program is written in C to represent how a TCP 3-way handshake works in practice. 

The server program initiates a TCP connection and listens to the client's connection request. The client sends an SYN header request to the server, to which the server replies with an SYN/ACK header. Finally, the client responds with an ACK header to indicate a successful TCP connection.
